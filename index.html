  <p>Open console and repeatedly run `test()`, which creates 100 LargeType instances which immediately become
    inaccessible (no references to them are left), and prints current wasm's buffer size after each. All deallocs should
    also be logged. You can also try `test(true)` to see what happens when .free() is called explicitely after 1s.</p>
